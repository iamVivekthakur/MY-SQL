Q). Suppose you have to create a table by the name of Record where columns should be id, name, age, salary and city?

ANSWER :- You need to follow the following command to make the table record :-


create table record(
id int auto_increment primary key,
name varchar (30),
age int, check (age>=18),
salary int, check (salary>=0),
department varchar(30) default 'Sales',
city varchar(30) default 'Delhi' 
);

Note :- There are some points in the table you might get confused which is being used :-

1). ID:- 

a). We should take id in a integer form so for that I have used int.

b). Auto_increment :- This is used so that every data you might be entering should get auto increment you dont have to give any number manually.

c). Primary:- These are those key which will help you to check whether there should not be any repeated and null values in the table.

2). NAME:-

Since the name is always in alphabets so I have used VARCHAR() in it.

3). AGE:-

Age is also measured in numerical form so for that int data type has been used. Another thing we could se is CHECK.

Check:- This is used to check whether the age entered is passing the criteria which has been entered through this check.

4). CITY AND DEPARTMENT :- Both are represented alphabetically so VARCHAR() has been used,

DEFAULT:- This command is used to check if any entery made is left empty so by default it would enter that particular assigned value.
