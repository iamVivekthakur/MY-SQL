SOME FURTHER QUERRIES RELATED TO MY SQL :-

THE CONCEPT OF JOIN :

THERE ARE FOUR TYPE OF JOINS IN MY SQL :-

1. INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables. 

2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.

3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.

4. CROSS JOIN / FULL JOIN : Returns all records from both tables.


EXAMPLE 1 :- CREATE TWO TABLES ONE OF STUDENT OTHER OF SPORTS :-

IN STUDENT TABLE CREATE COLUMNS BY THE NAME OF ROLL NUMBER, NAME AND SPORTS ID.

IN SPORTS TABLE CREATE COLUMNS BY THE NAME OF SPORTS ID, SPORTS NAME AND STATE.

AFTER MAKING THE TABLE USE :-

1. INNER JOIN

2. LEFT JOIN

3. RIGHT JOIN

4. CROSS JOIN

SOLUTION :-

     --------> CREATE TABLE STUDENTS (
               ROLL_NUMBER INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
               NAME VARCHAR(30),
               SPORTS_ID INT);
               
               
     --------> CREATE TABLE SPORTS (
               SPORTS_ID INT,
               SPORTS_NAME VARCHAR(30),
               STATE VARCHAR(30);
               
     COMMAND FOR JOINS :-
     
     --------> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS INNER JOIN SPORTS ON STUDENTS.SPORTS_ID=SPORTS.SPORTS_ID;
     
     --------> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS LEFT JOIN SPORTS ON STUDENTS.SPORTS_ID=SPORTS.SPORTS_ID;
     
     --------> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS RIGHT JOIN SPORTS ON STUDENTS.SPORTS_ID=SPORTS.SPORTS_ID;
     
     --------> SELECT * FROM STUDENTS CROSS JOIN SPORTS ON STUDENTS.SPORTS_ID=SPORTS.SPORTS_ID;
